# Cryptocurrency-in-Java
Designed a cryptocurrency model in Java. Defined roles of moderators, miners, and users, and appropriately developed the program. Used Merkle-trees and blockchains for proof-checking of transactions, and dened appropriate rewards and incentives
for miners. Developed procedures to limit the threat of malicious miners to a reasonable level.
